        <p>The past several years have been particularly eventful and successful for CUAC. In 2007, the Men's Blues team won the Varsity Match for the first time in ten years, setting a new record winning margin for a Cambridge team in the process. Match records fell again in the Men's Blues and Alverstone matches in 2009, whilst many Cambridge athletes also played integral roles in the team that defeated Harvard & Yale for the first time in sixteen years during the 2009 Transatlantic Series tour. The 2010 Varsity Match saw the first ever 4-0 Cambridge win at Iffley Road, while the 2011 edition was another 4-0 whitewash, with match record winning margins in both Blues matches. Cambridge equalled the 4-0 precedent in the 2015 most recent Varisty Match at Wilberforce Road. The club has nurtured a number of recent international stars, including: World and Olympic 1500m finalist Andy Baddeley, Commonwealth Heptathlon Medallist Grace Clements, and World Junior Championships Silver Medallist Louis Persent. Equally as impressive accolades exist amongst newer additions too, namely Lewis Lloyd and Emily Dudgeon having represented GB at the World Cross Country Championships and 800m in the World Juniors, respectively.</p>
